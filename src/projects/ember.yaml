fullDescription: |
  I'm a recovered note-taking nerd, hopping from Bear to Roam to Tana to Obsidian. What I've been searching for is a way to take my sporadic thoughts and make connections between them. It could be between sets at the gym, or wanting to voice my thoughts on a walk.

  That's what led to Ember. It's an app that let's you take quick notes, let's you chat with them, and dreams on your behalf. During those dreams, it surfaces questions to followup with you, so you can journal with only a few swipes.

  The most exciting part of this project was architecting a memory system that's efficient, accurate, and able to connect seemingly amorphous thoughts together.
