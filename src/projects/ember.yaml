fullDescription: |
  I'm a recovered note-taking nerd, hopping from Bear to Roam to Tana to Obsidian. What I've been searching for is a way to take my sporadic thoughts and make connections between them. It could be between sets at the gym, or wanting to voice my thoughts on a walk.

  That's what led to Ember. It's an app that let's you take quick notes, let's you chat with them, and dreams on your behalf and presents you with connections between them.

  The most fun part of working on this was architecting an AI-memory that's conducive to connecting thoughts.
