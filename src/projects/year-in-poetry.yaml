fullDescription: |
  Your Year in Poetry is an experimental project that transforms personal journal entries into meaningful poetry and art using AI.
  
  The project analyzes journal entries to identify emotional patterns and recurring themes, then uses these insights to generate 
  personalized poems and accompanying artwork that capture the essence of your year.
  
  Built using advanced language models and image generation AI, this project demonstrates the creative potential of AI in 
  personal reflection and self-expression.
