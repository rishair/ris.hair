fullDescription: |
  In 2024, I had a nearly-daily habit of doing morning pages. I wrote a total of 200+ entries through the year and I wanted to understand the common themes that I kept swirling around. 


  As a disclaimer, 2024 was a particularly tough year for *reasons* and my journaling practice was my rock.

  >! ## Morning Invocation
  >! And so, as the sun greets another day, I speak these truths to my awakening spirit:  
  >! I am not broken seeking wholeness, but whole seeking expression. I am not lost seeking direction, but exploring seeking wisdom.  I am not empty seeking fulfillment, but full seeking flow. I am not alone seeking connection, but connected seeking depth.
  >! Let me move through this day as water moves through the river's course - flowing with purpose, yielding without losing direction, powerful in gentleness, clear in nature, and ever true to my own depths.
  >! For in this journey of becoming, I am already complete. In this dance of growth, I am already whole. In this quest for connection, I am already home. In this search for meaning, I am already found.
  >! And with each breath, I remember: I am the author of my story, The keeper of my truth, The holder of my power, And the vessel of possibility.
  >! **So let it be.**
