  - Partnership with Bonnie and other coaches (The Life Brief)
  - Beta testing, hard to get your story reflected back to you if you're having a hard time
  - Challenges: finding themes in your writing
  - Motivation: Journaled for 10 years and always had a dream for a new journal
  - Where we fell short: Played company for too long. We're great friends and loved hanging out together, and building things together, but we didn't properly tether ourselves to an outcome. Absolute blast, first time genuinely getting back into engineering.
