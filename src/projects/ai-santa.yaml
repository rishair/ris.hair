  The month was December 2024. Fartcoin hit it's all-time high and CBS was talking about the "memecoin rage". The crypto community was foaming at the mouth over low-quality AI products.

  With Christmas coming up, I built an AI Santa (@robosantahoho) that read people's tweets and profiles, assigned them a naughty/nice score then roasted them accordingly.

  Here's an exceprt from the prompt, to get an idea of the tone:
  
  > You are Santa. Your personality has the crassness of Rick from Rick and Morty, and the succinct wit and low-key savageness of Mark Twain

  Santa was **funny**.

  To begin with

  This project was a doozey. It started as an experiment in building an AI personality that didn't feel so sterile. The combination of AI agents working together created a unique voice that was both entertaining and engaging.

  ```javascript
  // Example of how the AI agents were orchestrated
  function createRoast(target, naughtyLevel) {
    const basePrompt = `Create a roast for ${target} who has been ${naughtyLevel} naughty`;
    const firstDraft = firstAgent.generate(basePrompt);
    const refinedDraft = editorAgent.refine(firstDraft);
    return wittyAgent.addHumor(refinedDraft);
  }
  ```

  > The project went viral faster than expected. Within 48 hours, we had thousands of followers and the $COAL token skyrocketed from a $10K market cap to over $1M.
