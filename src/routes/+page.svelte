	<h2>I'm a <strong> product manager</strong> and <strong>software developer</strong> in Brooklyn, NY. </h2>

	<p>
		Now a days I'm building an AI x tool for thinking product at <a href="https://goodword.ing">Good Wording</a>.
	<p>

	<p>
		In my <strong>personal life</strong> I'm into psychology, evolution, nature, cycling, space, improv, yoga, and probably other things by now. I have roots in Virginia, San Francisco, and now Brooklyn. My friends and family mean everything to me.
	</p>
		
	<p>
		In my <strong>career</strong>, I've been a founder (3x), product manager, distributed systems engineer, front-end engineer (web & ios), and many things in between. My more notable accomplishments have been a 9-year stint at Twitter, bootstrapping a profitable startup with ~200K users, and ignoring a cease-and-desist from Activision.
	</p>
		
	<p>
		I'm a big fan of building beautiful products that help people understand themselves, connect with others, explore their curiosities, and have fun along the way. In other words, the products I wish existed.
