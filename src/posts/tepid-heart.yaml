  Heart has been hurt before. Brain and Gut have always ushered him to be bold, but even they've become wary over time. Can you blame them? Heart has been careless in the past and has the scars to show it. Over time, the arrangement has become that Brain protects the door, and only lets a select few in the home. Then Gut greets them warmly, staying tightly attuned to any disturbances in the breeze. Once they've deemed it safe, tepid Heart slinks out of his room to try again, and say hi.

  
  ...

  hi.
