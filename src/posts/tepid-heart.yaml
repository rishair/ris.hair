  Heart has been hurt before. Brain and Gut always urged him to be bold, but even they've grown wary over time. Can you blame them? Heart was a little careless in the past and has the scars to show it. Now Brain protects the door, and only lets a select few in the home. Gut greets them warmly, staying attuned to any disturbances in the breeze. Then, and only then, does tepid Heart slink out of his room to try again and say hi. 
  
  ...

  hi.
