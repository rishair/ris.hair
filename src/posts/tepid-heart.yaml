  Heart has been hurt before. Brain and Gut have always ushered it to be bold, but even they've become wary over time. It's hard to blame them, Heart has been careless before and has the scars to show it. Over time, the arrangement has become that Brain protects the door, and only lets a select few in the home. Then Gut greets her warmly, staying tightly attuned to any disturbances in the breeze. Once they've deemed it safe, tepid Heart slinks out of its room to try again and say hi.

  
  ...

  hi.
