  The waves hit the land
  Shore after shore
  Crashing, crawling -
  craving, commisserating

  Frothing bubbles bobbing for help
  Time passes with each grain
  Rolling, tumbling - 
  heaving, wheezing

  When does the breath
  Have a chance to sigh

  Lips wet with hunger
  Tongue seeking its cherry
  Thirst met but never quenched
  The air trembles in its wait

  Perhaps it's calmer where it all settles
  On the ocean floor
