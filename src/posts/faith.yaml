  Okay, let's see, what do I Want to write about here. Spirituality is kind of it, that's what I want to write about. 

  For the longest time, I had the faith that "everything happens for a reason". I weathered some nasty storms with that mentality, but through some especially tough times and life upheavals, I somehow lost sight of what that means. It went from a deeply personal philosophy to a cliche that I couldn't connect with. 

  That statement is a faith. It's an orientation towards the world where if you believe it, it makes life easier, lighter, more playful. I'm not sure how I picked up that faith, but one day I woke up and realized that I didn't have it anymore. Just like everything in my 30s, I'm starting to appreciate that the things that I had when I was younger I can't take for granted anymore. I account for my energy, my information diet, my exercise routine. And lately, I've been thinking more about the faiths that I choose to practice.

  That faith originally came to me when I was at the peak of naivete and success - I didn't know enough about life to understand the reality of it, and I was successful enough that I could float on top of it all. Through the years, I weathered some tough storms and one day I woke up and realized I had lost that faith. It was somber moment, to know that the primary fuel for my happy-go-lucky just disappeared. I missed being the person that believed in that.

  Every faith has its practice. At first, faith is held up with a belief about the world that's helpful to hold. For example, if I have faith that exercise will make me feel more confident, then the practice is exercising more. Eventually, as you practice the faith, you get to experience the results of it. In this case, if you feel more confident in 2 months, then your hollow faith now turns into a solid faith, one that has been substantiated by the world. 

  That's why choosing your faith, and choosing your practice, is an art. You want to choose faiths that are relevant to you, at your current point in life, and easily reinforced through a practice. 

  This gets interseting. The question then becomes, could I just have any faith? Well, let's take the faith of "If I work hard, then I will have a million dollars". I mean, yeah, that's a faith. What's the practice though that strengthens that faith on a regular basis? What is the first stepping stone that can provide that faith with evidence?

  It's working hard gets you $10. There, the faith is substantiated. Perhaps we can rework the faith to say, if I work hard, then a side effect of it will be money. That's a faith that you can practice on a regular basis.

  Another faith would be that everything happens for a reason. What's the practice that can help you substantiate that faith? Well, let's look back at all the other times in your life where something seemingly went wrong, and it actually led to a positive outcome.

  See, the thing about faith is that it's merely attention. Some might call this manifesting. With the gajillion datapoints we have about our lives, we can draw any conclusion about the world that we'd want to simply by drawing correlations. For any given individual, we can paint a bleak picture or an optimistic picture - it's simply which story do we choose to tell? We have full control over that story, however these stories are habits of thought. 

  Once you've embraced a story for long enough, that narrative finds a way to seep into all the crevices in your life. If you want to reverse a story, reverse a faith, then the first step is being aware of when you're telling yourself that story. Catch yourself in those moments, in that habit, and let yourself rest in the awareness of what you're doing. It's from that place of detachment from the story, that you have an opportunity to rewrite it.

  Here's an exercise - what's a faith that you want to take on? List one. Some examples are "everything happens for a reason", or "everything is connected" or "working hard will get me the life that I want".

  After you've picked your faith - come up with a practice that reinforces that faith. For example, if you chose "everything happens for a reason", then the practice could be coming up with 3 times that something that seemed disastrous in the moment blossomed into something that ended up being deeply meaningful. 

  Most people will read that and skim right over it - which is a common failure mode for people that want to better themselves. It's often thought that just having the insights will make you better, but really it's all about the *practice*. What is the faith that you want to embody, and what is the practice that you come back to every single day that helps you embody it?

  Truly, ask yourself these questions, and do the PRACTICE. That's when you'll actually start to see changes.

  Let's talk about those things.
  * My days are meaningful -> Write down all the small moments that are meaningful to you throughout a day
  * The world is on my side -> Carry around thank you cards and leave them for people when they help you.
  * Everything is connected -> Read sci-fi, draw connections to your points.

  Practice doesn't have to be big. You don't have to sign up for a buddhist temple to start to feel the connection you're yearning for. It's a matter of attention, and allowing yourself to connect the dots. If you feel that you're not able to connect the dots, then figure out why.

  What else comes to mind here? I want to know who my audience is here. I think I'm talking to the Rishi that was shortly after the divorce, and struggling to find air. I think once IF ound it, it wasn't a matter of hunkering down, it was.. it was adopting all these faiths, starting up from a place of being lost, and rebuilding my world and my way of being. It happened after a trauamtic time, after a depression, and building back. That's what it was. I was building back better. Wow, that's what I could make my blog. Building back better.

  Okay, so, that person felt lost.. and without puropse, and unconnected. I think that's it. Feels unconnected to the world. What I want to do is build up a practice that helps me connect to the world more. How do I do that? I think its' feeling all the connections, taking note of all the ways I'm connected to other people. All the times that a small off-chance encounter snowballed into a huge moment of synchronicity. Synchronicity is something to perceive, it's always available to us, and it's a matter of tapping into it. Believing it's all around us, then following those threads. Infuse everything with a meaning, but hold it loosely. Everything matters, but you won't know in which circumstance it comes to fruition. It's only in hindsight that you're able to connect the dots, but the power comes when having faith that you can connect the dots forward too.

  The danger of specific faiths, or "manifesting"

  If you have a faith that is too specific, then it's difficult to practice it. The
