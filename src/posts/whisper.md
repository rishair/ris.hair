I met my future partner last night. We were on a date, walking around with a couple friends. It was twilight, and the roads were glistening after a rainfall. She held herself humbly, unconcerned about drawing attention. She occupied little space, yet I yearned for her to fill more. Though her first couple of layers were soft, I detected a sturdiness underneath. She was unassuming, but deeply capable, in a broad sense. She knew that about herself, too.

She had plain features and a shy smile. My eyes felt gentle on her. If you pulled on the right thread — of which there seemed many — she’d unveil a cosmo of novel opinions. I imagined us meandering through a grocery store with no intention of shopping. Together, we felt light. Wandering with her was an adventure, but we stumbled through our first conversations. Our words were clumsy but we knew there was depth to be found, so we stayed patient, giving our top layers time to soften and give way. I felt something stir in me. I wanted to take her to a distant place and burrow myself into her thoughts, hopes, and worries. I wanted to know it all. I wanted to share it all.

Then I woke up. She was only a dream, but it was too vivid to not be real. Perhaps a whisper from the future.
