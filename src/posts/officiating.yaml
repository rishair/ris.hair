  I recently officiated a wedding for two of my best friends. I was told about officiating them 6 months before the wedding, but the script only came together 2 days before the big day. There are tons of guides out there on how to write the perfect officiant speech, and I think I've read about all of them, but I wanted to talk about how to write it in the most painstaking way possible.

  The pressure
  * Two of my best friends, and it's the most important part of their day, and you're in charge

  Day of energy
  * Channel your daddy energy. Visualize success

  Find youtube personalities
  * Jeff Maeck


  Writing the speech
  * Writers block

  Interviewing the couple
